# 3-Day Learning Challenge README

## Introduction

Welcome to my 3-day learning challenge! In the next 3 days, I will be pushing my limits to gain an introduction to a variety of web development technologies and concepts. This README serves as a roadmap for my condensed learning journey, outlining what I intend to achieve during this short period.

## Challenge Overview

**Duration**: 3 days

**Objective**: To gain an introductory understanding of key web development technologies and concepts.

## Goals

During this 3-day challenge, I will focus on gaining a basic understanding of the following technologies and concepts:

1. **NestJS**: I will aim to grasp the fundamental concepts of NestJS, including its architecture, modules, controllers, and services.

2. **Databases**: I will explore both SQL databases using Sequelize and NoSQL databases with MongoDB, focusing on basic operations and modeling.

3. **Asynchronous Communication**: I will study RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging and learn how to send and receive messages.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**: I will gain an introductory understanding of authentication using Passport.js and basic authorization concepts.

5. **Caching with Redis**: I will learn the basics of Redis and how it can be used for caching.

6. **Microservices**: I will explore the fundamentals of microservices architecture and its benefits.

7. **API Documentation**: I will briefly look at Swagger for API documentation.

## Daily Plan

Here's a condensed daily plan for the 3 days:

### Day 1: Foundations and Basics

- **Morning**: Dive into NestJS basics, setting up a simple project and creating a basic API endpoint.
- **Afternoon**: Focus on Sequelize for SQL databases and explore MongoDB for NoSQL.
- **Evening**: Begin understanding RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.

### Day 2: Middleware and Authentication

- **Morning**: Explore NestJS middleware and create custom middleware for basic functionalities.
- **Afternoon**: Dive into authentication with Passport.js.
- **Evening**: Begin understanding Redis for caching.

### Day 3: Advanced Concepts and Documentation

- **Morning**: Study microservices fundamentals and their advantages.
- **Afternoon**: Briefly look at Swagger for API documentation.
- **Evening**: Dedicate time to testing and integrating the technologies learned.

## Progress Tracking

I will update this README daily with progress reports, code snippets, and any challenges or insights I encounter during my intense 3-day learning challenge. Feel free to follow along and provide feedback or suggestions if you have any.

## Conclusion

This 3-day learning challenge is an ambitious endeavor, and I look forward to gaining an introductory understanding of these technologies and concepts. Let's make the most of these three days of focused learning!

**Start Date**: [12/09/2023]

**End Date**: [15/09/2023]
