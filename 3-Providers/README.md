# NestJS Providers

Providers are a fundamental concept in NestJS, serving as the building blocks of your application's functionality. They are responsible for encapsulating various parts of your code, handling dependencies, and promoting reusability.

## What Are Providers?

Providers are classes in NestJS that serve specific purposes within your application:

- **Injectable Dependencies:** Providers can be injected into other classes, such as controllers, services, or other providers, to provide their functionality. This promotes a modular and organized architecture for your application.

- **Encapsulating Logic:** You can encapsulate specific logic or functionality within a provider. For instance, you might have a UserService provider to handle user-related operations like user creation, updating, and deletion.

- **Singleton Instances:** By default, providers are treated as singletons in NestJS. This means there's only one instance of each provider within the application's lifecycle, ensuring efficient resource usage.

## Using Providers

To use a provider, follow these steps:

1. Create a provider class by decorating it with the `@Injectable()` decorator.

  ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

   @Injectable()
   export class MyProvider {
     // Your provider's logic here
   }
 ```

Inject the provider into the classes or modules where you need its functionality.

   
 
Register the provider in a module. This is typically done using the providers array within the module decorator.

  ```typescript
        import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
        import { MyProvider } from './my-provider';
 
         @Injectable() 
         export class MyService {
             constructor(private readonly myProvider: MyProvider) {}
           // Your service logic using MyProvider
          }
   ```

     @Module({
          providers: [MyProvider, MyService],
    })
    export class MyModule {}
 ```

## Summary

Providers are a core concept in NestJS, enabling modularity, code organization, and efficient dependency management. They are essential for creating maintainable and scalable applications.
