# Sample Analytics üìä

## Purpose:
The `sample-analytics` project is focused on handling analytics-related functionality within a microservices architecture.
- It listens for events related to user creation (`user_created`) and collects analytics data based on these events.
- It provides an API to retrieve the collected analytics data.

## Key Components:
- **AppController**: Defines HTTP routes and event handlers (user creation, analytics retrieval).
- **AppService**: Handles business logic, including handling user creation events and managing analytics data.
- **CreateUserEvent**: Event class representing the creation of a user.
- **AppModule**: Configures the Nest.js application module, registering controllers and services.
- **main.ts**: Bootstraps the Nest.js application as a microservice, connecting via TCP and listening on port 3001.

## Order of Execution:
1. The Nest.js application is bootstrapped as a microservice.
2. The application starts listening for events (e.g., `user_created`) and exposes an API to retrieve analytics.
3. When a `user_created` event is received, analytics data is updated.

# Sample Backend üíº

## Purpose:
The `sample-backend` project represents a backend service within a microservices architecture.
- It handles HTTP requests related to user creation and analytics retrieval.
- It emits events related to user creation to other microservices (communication and analytics).

## Key Components:
- **AppController**: Defines HTTP routes for handling user creation, analytics retrieval, and a basic hello message.
- **AppService**: Handles business logic, including creating users and emitting events for user creation.
- **CreateUserRequest**: DTO (Data Transfer Object) representing the request to create a user.
- **CreateUserEvent**: Event class representing the creation of a user.
- **AppModule**: Configures the Nest.js application module, registering controllers and services.
- **main.ts**: Bootstraps the Nest.js application.

## Order of Execution:
1. The Nest.js application is bootstrapped.
2. The application starts listening for HTTP requests related to user creation and analytics retrieval.
3. When a user is created, events related to user creation are emitted to other microservices (communication and analytics).

# Sample Communication üì®

## Purpose:
The `sample-communication` project represents a communication microservice within a microservices architecture.
- It handles HTTP requests and listens for events related to user creation.

## Key Components:
- **AppController**: Defines HTTP routes and event handlers for handling requests and user creation events.
- **AppService**: Handles business logic, including handling user creation events.
- **CreateUserEvent**: Event class representing the creation of a user.
- **AppModule**: Configures the Nest.js application module, registering controllers and services.
- **main.ts**: Bootstraps the Nest.js application as a microservice, connecting via TCP and listening on a port.

## Order of Execution:
1. The Nest.js application is bootstrapped as a microservice.
2. The application starts listening for HTTP requests and events related to user creation.
3. When a `user_created` event is received, appropriate actions are taken, e.g., sending an email to the user.

# Summary:

## Interconnected Microservices üåê:
- These projects represent individual microservices within a larger microservices architecture.
- Each microservice has a specific purpose and communicates with other microservices through events and HTTP requests.

## Decomposition of Functionality üß©:
- The functionalities are broken down into smaller, manageable units (microservices), allowing for independent development, scalability, and maintenance.

## Event-Driven Communication üöÄ:
- Microservices communicate via events (e.g., `user_created`) to achieve loose coupling and asynchronous processing.

## API Exposition üõ†Ô∏è:
- Each microservice exposes APIs to handle specific functionality (e.g., user creation, analytics retrieval) that can be accessed by other parts of the system.
