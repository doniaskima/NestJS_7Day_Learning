# Nest.js Introduction

[Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) is a powerful and extensible Node.js framework designed for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. Inspired by Angular and developed with TypeScript, Nest.js combines the best practices of both frontend and backend development, making it a popular choice among developers for building modern, full-stack applications.

## Key Features

- **Modularity**: Nest.js encourages a modular and organized code structure. It uses modules to encapsulate related components, making the application easier to understand and maintain.

- **Dependency Injection**: Leveraging TypeScript decorators, Nest.js provides a powerful dependency injection system that promotes code reusability and testability.

- **Express.js Compatibility**: Nest.js is built on top of the Express.js framework, which means it seamlessly integrates with Express while adding additional features and abstractions.

- **GraphQL and REST Support**: Nest.js supports both GraphQL and RESTful APIs out of the box, giving developers the flexibility to choose the API paradigm that best suits their project.

- **WebSockets**: Real-time applications are easy to implement in Nest.js thanks to its built-in support for WebSockets.
